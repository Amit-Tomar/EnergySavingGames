Energy Sudoku
--------------------------

Just like the original game Sudoku, Energy Sudoku is a logic-based, number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with images so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or "sub-squares") contains all of the images from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which typically has a unique solution. Instead of normal number from 1 to 9, Energy Sudoku is provided with 9 different images.
